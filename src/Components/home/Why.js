        Approximately half of the U.S. immigrant population is limited English proficient (LEP). The language barrier leads to stress and health issues and hinders immigrantsâ€™ employment opportunities, social environment, and more. Existing translation services fail to capture the context and complexity of situations, and are often unusable for immigrants with limited reading and writing comprehension in their home language. 
      </p>
      <p style={{ marginBottom: '40px' }}>
        Our app provides real-time, interactive translation help from multilingual volunteers who can further explain translations and the context surrounding them, whether cultural or technological. Wave helps limited English proficient users navigate daily life with independence and peace of mind.
